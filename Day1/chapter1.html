<h3><u><b>What is the SDLC Waterfall Model?</b></u></h3>
The waterfall model is a software development model used in the context of large, complex projects,
typically in the field of information technology. It is characterized by a structured, sequential 
approach to project management and software development.

The waterfall model is useful in situations where the project requirements are well-defined 
and the project goals are clear. It is often used for large-scale projects with long timelines,
where there is little room for error and the project stakeholders need to have a high level of 
confidence in the outcome.
         

<h3><b><u>Features of the SDLC Waterfall Model</u></b></h3>
<b>Sequential Approach:</b> 
The waterfall model involves a sequential approach to software development, where each phase of 
the project is completed before moving on to the next one.
<b>Document-Driven:</b> 
The waterfall model relies heavily on documentation to ensure that the project is well-defined 
and the project team is working towards a clear set of goals.
<b>Quality Control:</b>
 The waterfall model places a high emphasis on quality control and testing at each phase of the project,
  to ensure that the final product meets the requirements and expectations of the stakeholders.
<b>Rigorous Planning:</b> 
The waterfall model involves a rigorous planning process, where the project scope, timelines,
and deliverables are carefully defined and monitored throughout the project lifecycle.
Overall, the waterfall model is used in situations where there is a need for a highly structured 
and systematic approach to software development. It can be effective in ensuring that large, 
complex projects are completed on time and within budget, with a high level of quality and customer satisfaction.

<h3><b><u>Importance of SDLC Waterfall Model</u></b></h3>
<b>Clarity and Simplicity:</b> 
The linear form of the Waterfall Model offers a simple and unambiguous 
foundation for project development.
<b>Clearly Defined Phases:</b> 
The Waterfall Modelâ€™s phases each have unique inputs and outputs,
 guaranteeing a planned development with obvious checkpoints.
<b>Documentation:</b> 
A focus on thorough documentation helps with software comprehension, upkeep, and future growth.
<b>Stability in Requirements:</b> 
Suitable for projects when the requirements are clear and steady, reducing modifications as
 the project progresses.
<b>Resource Optimization:</b> 
It encourages effective task-focused work without continuously changing contexts by allocating
 resources according to project phases.
<b>Relevance for Small Projects:</b> 
Economical for modest projects with simple specifications and minimal complexity.
<h3><b><u>Phases of SDLC Waterfall Model </u></b></h3>
Design
The Waterfall Model is a classical software development methodology that was first 
introduced by Winston W. Royce in 1970. It is a linear and sequential approach to software 
development that consists of several phases that must be completed in a specific order.

<h3><b><u>The Waterfall Model has six phases which are:</u></b></h3>

<b>1. Requirements:</b>
 The first phase involves gathering requirements from stakeholders and analyzing them
  to understand the scope and objectives of the project.

<b>2. Design: </b>
Once the requirements are understood, the design phase begins. This involves creating a 
detailed design document that outlines the software architecture, user interface, and system components.

<b>3. Development:</b> 
The Development phase include implementation involves coding the software based on the design 
specifications. This phase also includes unit testing to ensure that each component of the software is 
working as expected.

<b>4. Testing:</b> In the testing phase, the software is tested as a whole to ensure that it meets
 the requirements and is free from defects.

<b>5. Deployment:</b> Once the software has been tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment.

<b>6. Maintenance:</b> The final phase of the Waterfall Model is maintenance, which involves fixing any issues 
that arise after the software has been deployed and ensuring that it continues to meet the requirements over time. 

The classical waterfall model divides the life cycle into a set of phases. This model considers that one phase can be 
started after the completion of the previous phase. That is the output of one phase will be the input to the next phase.
Thus the development process can be considered as a sequential flow in the waterfall. Here the phases do not overlap with
 each other. The different sequential phases of the classical waterfall model are shown in the below figure.
