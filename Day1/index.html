       Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.<br/>

  Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within
 it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage,
  you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages 
  (HTML documents) with each other.<br/>
Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout 
and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive 
and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.<br/>

Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by 
a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of 
the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.
